# Welcome to My MDX Document!
This is a sample document written in MDX (Markdown + JSX). MDX allows you to seamlessly mix Markdown and React components. Let's explore some features:

## Markdown Basics

- **Bold Text**: You can make text **bold** using double asterisks.
- *Italic Text*: Use single asterisks or underscores for *italic* text.
- Lists:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

## React Components

You can embed React components directly in your MDX:

## Code Blocks

```javascript
const greet = (name) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};
```

console.log(greet("World"));
